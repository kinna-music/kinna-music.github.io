# What Have I Lost

This is a trio for viola, cello and double bass - with an accompanying film made from footage I took through a telescope on the coast of Devon. This piece questions the feeling of loss that can arise when a project, friendship, relationship (or even an enjoyable period of your life!) ends. You may feel as though you have lost something, but in reality you can only gain experience from life! By filming the boat freely sailing in the distance, I wanted to capture the ease and flow that can occur when you allow life to happen and don't grasp at any particular thing or feeling.
