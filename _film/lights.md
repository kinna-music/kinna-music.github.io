**Winner of the RA Arts Club Award 2023**

&lsquo;Lights&rsquo; was displayed at the Royal Academy&rsquo;s 2023 Summer Exhibition and was chosen for the Under-35 Arts Club Award.

&ldquo;The idea for this film came when I was on an evening walk at Littlehampton beach. I found the harbour lights particularly beautiful and I noticed that they were slightly out of sync with each other. The gradual rhythmic change of the lights inspired a two-part minimalistic composition, where the treble parts follow the green light and the bass parts follow the red light. In this recording, only the violin and cello are present throughout the entire film. The other instruments (including the alto saxophone, guitar, xylophone, piano, trombone and bass clarinet) are introduced at different points during the film, to create textural change. The timing between the two musical parts slowly shifts, with the lights, alongside the gradual darkening of the harbour.&rdquo;
