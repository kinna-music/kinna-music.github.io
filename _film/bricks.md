# Bricks

This film captures different bricks from Birmingham's city centre, and the soundscapes around them, which draws the viewers' attention to a core component of our society that we often take for granted.



In early 2023 I became slightly obsessed with bricks! I want the viewer to notice the beauty in each brick filmed and to become more aware of the useful things we take for granted.

By filming long, still, close-up shots of these bricks, the viewer is encouraged to explore the visuals presented to them. Watching this film becomes an exploratory experience, instead of a passive one. When filming, I recorded the soundscape surrounding each individual brick. By not being able to see what is producing the sounds, I found that I paid more attention to the sonic environment and this also lead me to imagine what the brick may be witnessing off-screen.
