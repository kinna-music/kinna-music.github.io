# Bricks

This is a four-minute extract of 'Bricks':

"Earlier this year, I became slightly obsessed with bricks! I wanted the viewer to notice the beauty in each brick I filmed and to become more aware of the useful things we take for granted.

By filming long, still, close-up shots of these bricks, the viewer is encouraged to explore the visuals presented to them. Watching this film becomes an exploratory experience, instead of a passive one. When filming, I recorded the soundscape surrounding each individual brick. By not being able to see what is producing the sounds, I found that I paid more attention to the sonic environment and this also lead me to imagine what the brick may be witnessing off-screen."
