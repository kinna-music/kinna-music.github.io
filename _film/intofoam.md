# Into Foam

Into Foam is a visual and sonic exploration of The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen.

"I began this film by distilling Andersen's work down to four words: mutilation, sacrifice, love and pain. All the sounds and images are directly inspired by the story. For example, the radio sound represents the lack of communication between the little mermaid and the prince (due to her voice being taken by the sea witch) and the visual of the upright moving knives portray the feeling of the mermaid dancing at the prince's wedding ('Sharp knives seemed to cut her delicate feet, yet she hardly felt them, so deep was the pain in her heart')."
