Her Revelation combines electronic and vocal improvisation with thought-provoking lyrics (some also improvised), to create mesmerizing, emotional music. With Peter Bell and Vato Klemera, we began improvising and performing together in early 2023. This is our second live performance, from the Royal Birmingham conservatoire's CODA festival in June. It features two of our songs: 'Actress' and 'Leave Me', with a lot of improvisation in between!
