This is a (mostly) live album, recorded in 2022, that includes collaborations with jazz bassist Adam Roberts and jazz drummer Tom Phillips. These songs bring together multiple musical influences, such as early rock, folk music and contemporary jazz. Many lyrical themes are explored throughout the album, including meditation, consumerism and the current state of the natural world. Kinna has also featured two songs where she sings at the cello (instead of the piano).
