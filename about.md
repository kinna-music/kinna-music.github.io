# About Kinna

![Kinna](/static/images/kinna_bw325.jpg)

Kinna is a British composer, singer, visual artist and musician. Her work is multi-faceted and includes songwriting, concert compositions, art film, music/sound production and performing. Inspired by American minimalist composers, British art rock musicians and installation artists, Kinna draws influences from many artistic disciplines to create eclectic and exciting new work.

Kinna’s work has been performed and displayed at Centrala, Flatpack Festival, T Street Gallery, Eastside Projects (Birmingham), the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, Peckham Festival and the Royal Academy of Music (London). The film Lights was selected to be displayed in the 2023 Royal Academy of Art Summer Exhibition and was awarded the Arts Club Under-35 Award. Her work has been played on BBC Radio Sussex and Brum Radio, which included an interview on The Glass Age. Amongst many commissions, Kinna has composed new works for Quatuor Bozzini and Flow Unit 3 and she was selected to compose a new fanfare for George Lewis’ honorary doctorate ceremony. She has also worked on many collaborative projects, including a multi-media dance project Language of Tapestry with theatre-maker Alexander Kaniewski.

Alongside composition and film, Kinna is an accomplished singer and instrumentalist. She often performs her songs self-accompanied at the piano, harpsichord or cello. While studying with Gavin Bryars, she was inspired to learn the viola da gamba and to play the harpsichord, which has greatly influenced her songwriting. Kinna has also recently formed a new electronic music group Her Revelation, in which she is the vocalist. While at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, Kinna has performed (as a cellist) in a string quartet and in the RBC Symphony Orchestra and Final Projects Orchestra. She has also performed with a variety of ensembles on the viola da gamba. Previously, she has performed in Howard Moody’s Opera  Agreed at Glyndebourne (2019) and in the BBC Proms with Jonny Greenwood (2018).

Kinna is currently completing a degree in composition at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. Previously she studied composition at the Junior Department of the Royal Academy of Music.


_"Kinna’s work leads from a sonic perspective to bring the daily activity of people into the metaphysical, creating a sense of awareness of our changing world and climate with a calm stance; which aims to leave the viewer not in a state of fear for our collective environmental and social impact, but with an understanding of the one eco-system we all reside within and the very nature of our interconnectedness."_ - T Street Gallery, on Kinna’s solo exhibition ‘Dyad’
