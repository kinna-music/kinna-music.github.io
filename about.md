# About Kinna

![Kinna](/static/images/kinna_bw325.jpg)

I am a singer-songwriter, composer and film-maker, currently studying in Birmingham (UK). My work often focuses on my voice, and I enjoy singing with the piano, cello or (as a recent addition) the viola da gamba. I tend to turn inward for my lyrics, which often results in them being slightly ambiguous, however I aim to share personal stories that connect to others.
